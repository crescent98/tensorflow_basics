# Image Segmentation
It is a basic Image Segmentation code, in Tensorflow, ofcourse based on Tensorflow  
[Image Segmenation in Tensorflow]("https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/segmentation?hl=ko#%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80_%EB%B6%84%ED%95%A0%EC%9D%B4%EB%9E%80") 

Well, It has some changes too.  
The ipynb file is the original code.  
I made some difference in the structure by spliting to models.py, train.py, utils.py  
After all, having some thoughts to generalize this stuff.  

  
Again, thanks to Tensorflow to make me a better man.
