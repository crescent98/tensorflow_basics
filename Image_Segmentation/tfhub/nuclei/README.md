# Nuclei Segmentation

### a simple modulation for an existing segmentation code
[kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/advaitsave/tensorflow-2-nuclei-segmentation-unet)

#### I got this code for these points  
1. It is written in TF2, which is reeeaaaally rare  
2. The Layers are written, not sure whether it is exact U-Net, but it makes better comprehension  
3. The code seems cool  

Thanks to Advaitsave in Kaggle, you made me a better man.
